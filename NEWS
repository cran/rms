   * Prepare for version 2.36-1 of survival package by adding censor=FALSE argument to survfit.coxph
   * Added type="ccterms" to various predict methods
   * Made type="ccterms" the default for partial g-indexes in gIndex, i.e., combine all indirectly related (through interactions) terms
   * Added Spiegelhalter calibration test to val.prob
   * Added a check in cph to trigger an error if strata() is used in formula
   * Fixed drawing of polygon for shaded confidence bands for survplot.survfit (thanks to Patrick Breheny <patrick.breheny@uky.edu>)

   * Used a namespace and simplified referenced to a few survival package functions that survival actually exports

Changes in version 3.0-0 (2010-05-16)
   * Made Gls not store data label() in residuals object, instead storing a label of 'Residuals'
   * Fixed handling of na.action and check for presence of offsets in Glm
   * Added type="cterms" to predict methods; computes combined terms for main effects + any interaction terms involving that main effect; in preparation for new geffects function
   * Added GiniMd and gIndex functions
   * Change lrm (lrm.fit) to use the middle intercept in computing Brier score
   * Added 3 g-indexes to lrm fits
   * Added 1 g-index to ols, Rq, Glm, Gls fits
   * Added 2 g-indexes to cph, psm fits
   * Added g to validate.ols, .lrm, .cph, .psm, but not to validate.bj
   * Added print.validate to set default digits to 4
   * Changed validate.lrm to compute 3 indexes even on ordinal response data

Changes in version 2.2-0 (2010-02-23)
   * Added levels.only option to survplot.* to remove variablename= from curve labels
   * Added digits argument to calibrate.default
   * Added new ref in val.prob help page
   * Corrected location of dataset in residuals.lrm help page (thanks frederic.holzwarth@bgc-jena.mpg.de)
   * Fixed latex.rms to latex-escape percent signs inside value labels
   * Added scat1d.opts to plot.Predict
   * Changed method of specifying variables to vary by not requiring an equals sign and a dot after the variable name, for Predict, summary, nomogram, gendata, survplot.rms
   * Added factors argument to Predict to handle the above for survplot
   * Made gendata a non-generic function, changed the order of its arguments, removed editor options, relying on R de function always
   * Thanks to Kevin Thorpe <kevin.thorpe@utoronto.ca> to make latex.summary.rms and latex.anova.rms respect the table.env argument
   * Fixed bug in calibrate.default related to digits argument
   * Re-wrote bplot to use lattice graphics (e.g., levelplot contourplot wireframe), allowing for multiple panels for 3-d plots
   * Changed all Rd files to use {arg1,arg2,...} instead of having empty {}

Changes in version 2.1-0 (2009-09-30)
   * Made Predict not return invisibly if predictors not specified
   * New option nlines for plot.Predict for getting line plots with 2 categorical predictors
