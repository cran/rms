Changes in version 2.1-0 (2009-09-30)
   * Made Predict not return invisibly if predictors not specified
   * New option nlines for plot.Predict for getting line plots with 2 categorical predictors
   * Added rename option to rbind.Predict to handle case where predictor name has changed between models
   * Added ties=mean to approx( ) calls that did not have ties= specified
   * Added nlevels argument to bplot to pass to contour
   * Added par argument to iLegend - list to pass to par().
   * Redirected ... argument to iLegend to image( ).
   * Fixed groupkm - was printing warning messages wrongly
   * Added new semiparametric survival prediction calibration curve method in val.surv for external validation; this is the first implementation of smooth calibration curves for survival probability validation with right-censored data
   * Fixed calibrate confidence limits from groupkm
   * Added smooth calibration curve using hare (polspline package) for calibrate.cph and calibrate.psm
   * Added display of predicted risks for cph and psm models even for the stratified KM method (old default)

Changes in version 2.2-0 (2010-02-23)
   * Added levels.only option to survplot.* to remove variablename= from curve labels
   * Added digits argument to calibrate.default
   * Added new ref in val.prob help page
   * Corrected location of dataset in residuals.lrm help page (thanks frederic.holzwarth@bgc-jena.mpg.de)
   * Fixed latex.rms to latex-escape percent signs inside value labels
   * Added scat1d.opts to plot.Predict
   * Changed method of specifying variables to vary by not requiring an equals sign and a dot after the variable name, for Predict, summary, nomogram, gendata, survplot.rms
   * Added factors argument to Predict to handle the above for survplot
   * Made gendata a non-generic function, changed the order of its arguments, removed editor options, relying on R de function always
   * Thanks to Kevin Thorpe <kevin.thorpe@utoronto.ca> to make latex.summary.rms and latex.anova.rms respect the table.env argument
   * Fixed bug in calibrate.default related to digits argument
   * Re-wrote bplot to use lattice graphics (e.g., levelplot contourplot wireframe), allowing for multiple panels for 3-d plots
   * Changed all Rd files to use {arg1,arg2,...} instead of having empty {}
