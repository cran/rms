rms is a new package that accompanies FE Harrell's book Regression
Modeling Strategies.  It is a replacement for the Design package for
R.  It requires the Hmisc package.  rms does not use any C level
interfaces to other packages as Design did to the survival package.
Thus rms will be easier to maintain.

rms has cleaned up graphics routines in Design to make graphics
routines more modular, to use lattice graphics, and to make it easier
to use ggplot2 graphics.  Defaults for confidence bands are now gray
scale-shaded polygons.

The most visable change to the user is the replacement of the
plot.Design function with the Predict, plot.Predict, and bplot
functions.  plot.Predict is used for bivariate graphics (using lattice),
and bplot is used for 3-d graphics using base graphics functions
image, contour, and persp.  Multi-panel lattice graphics are usually
better than 3-d graphics for showing the effects of multiple
predictors varying simultaneously.

rms also implements a high-level interface to the quantreg package
through the new Rq function.


Visable to User
---------------
plot(fit, x1=NA, x2=NA, ...) changed to
 p <- Predict(fit, x1=., x2=., ...)
 plot(p)         # ?plot.Predict for details

plot(fit, .., method='image' or 'contour' or 'persp') changed to
 p <- Predict(...)
 bplot(p, ...)   # ?bplot for details

datadensity is no longer a separate function to use after the
predictions are plotted; the user specifies data= to plot.Predict to
get a rug plot, for example.

Legend was changed to iLegend

nomogram does not plot by default.  You must use plot(nomogram result)
to plot, and the plotting arguments are separated into the arguments
for plot.nomogram.

survplot defaults to conf='bands' and this now produces shaded
 confidence bands instead of bands made by pairs of lines

Varcov is changed to the more R-base concordant vcov

glmD is renamed Glm
glsD is renamed Gls


Other
-----
Removed all uses of single() or storage.mode 'single'
Removed all use of .newSurvival
predictDesign changed to predictrms
 Added ref.zero argument
There is no longer a generic nomogram function, so nomogram.Design was
renamed nomogram.


To correct:
 help page for predictrms
  center.terms not refer to means but adjustment values
  document ref.zero

To clean up later:
 When bug fixed in survfit.coxph.null remove n.all stuff


To do: After survival is updated, n.all workaround can be removed.
After Hmisc is updated, makeSteps can be removed from rmsMisc.s and
from rms-internal.Rd.

Changes since version 2.0-0
---------------------------
Separated help file for val.surv from that for val.prob
Renamed file name for Overview help file from zzzDesignOverview to
 zzzrmsOverview
