\title{
Validate Predicted Probabilities Against Observed Survival Times
}
\description{
The \code{val.surv} function is useful for validating predicted survival
probabilities against right-censored failure times.  If \code{u} is
specified, the hazard regression function \code{hare} in the
\code{polspline} package is used to relate predicted survival
probability at time \code{u} to observed survival times (and censoring
indicators) to estimate the actual survival probability at time
\code{u} as a function of the estimated survival probability at that
time, \code{est.surv}.  If \code{est.surv} is not given, \code{fit} must
be specified and the \code{survest} function is used to obtain the
predicted values (using \code{newdata} if it is given, or using the
stored linear predictor values if not).  \code{hare} is given the sole
predictor \code{fun(est.surv)} where \code{fun} is given by the user or
is inferred from \code{fit}.  \code{fun} is the function of predicted
survival probabilities that one expects to create a linear relationship
with the linear predictors.

\code{hare} uses an adaptive procedure to find a linear spline of
\code{fun(est.surv)} in a model where the log hazard is a linear spline
in time \eqn{t}, and cross-products between the two splines are allowed so as to
not assume proportional hazards.  Thus \code{hare} assumes that the
covariate and time functions are smooth but not much else, if the number
of events in the dataset is large enough for obtaining a reliable
flexible fit.  There are special \code{print} and \code{plot} methods
when \code{u} is given.  In this case, \code{val.surv} returns an object
of class \code{"val.survh"}, otherwise it returns an object of class
\code{"val.surv"}.

If \code{u} is not specified, \code{val.surv} uses Cox-Snell (1968)
residuals on the cumulative 
probability scale to check on the calibration of a survival model
against right-censored failure time data.  If the predicted survival
probability at time \eqn{t} for a subject having predictors \eqn{X} is
\eqn{S(t|X)}, this method is based on the fact that the predicted
probability of failure before time \eqn{t}, \eqn{1 - S(t|X)}, when
evaluated at the subject's actual survival time \eqn{T}, has a uniform
(0,1) distribution.  The quantity \eqn{1 - S(T|X)} is right-censored
when \eqn{T} is.  By getting one minus the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the
distribution of \eqn{1 - S(T|X)} and plotting against the 45 degree line
we can check for calibration accuracy.  A more stringent assessment can
be obtained by stratifying this analysis by an important predictor
variable.  The theoretical uniform distribution is only an approximation
when the survival probabilities are estimates and not population values.

When \code{censor} is specified to \code{val.surv}, a different
validation is done that is more stringent but that only uses the
uncensored failure times.  This method is used for type I censoring when
the theoretical censoring times are known for subjects having uncensored
failure times.  Let \eqn{T}, \eqn{C}, and \eqn{F} denote respectively
the failure time, censoring time, and cumulative failure time
distribution (\eqn{1 - S}).  The expected value of \eqn{F(T | X)} is 0.5
when \eqn{T} represents the subject's actual failure time.  The expected
value for an uncensored time is the expected value of \eqn{F(T | T \leq
C, X) = 0.5 F(C | X)}.  A smooth plot of \eqn{F(T|X) - 0.5 F(C|X)} for
uncensored \eqn{T} should be a flat line through \eqn{y=0} if the model
is well calibrated.  A smooth plot of \eqn{2F(T|X)/F(C|X)} for
uncensored \eqn{T} should be a flat line through \eqn{y=1.0}. The smooth
plot is obtained by smoothing the (linear predictor, difference or
ratio) pairs.

\item{est.surv}{
a vector of estimated survival probabilities corresponding to times in
the first column of \code{S}.

     \code{val.surv} is the limits for predictions from \code{datadist},
     which for large \eqn{n} is the 10th smallest and 10th largest
     predicted survival probability.  For \code{plot.val.survh}, the

     histogram is used if the sample size exceeds 200.}

     \code{plot.val.survh}.  Otherwise, \dots contains optional
     arguments for \code{plsmo} or \code{plot}.   For
     \code{print.val.survh}, \dots is ignored.}

show the difference between cumulative probabilities and their
expectation given the censoring time.  Set \code{what="ratio"} to show the
ratio instead.
}
\item{type}{
Set to the default (\code{"l"}) to plot the trend line only, \code{"b"}
to plot both individual subjects ratios and trend lines, or
\code{"p"} to plot only points. 
}
\item{xlim}{
}
\item{ylim}{
axis limits for \code{plot.val.surv} when the \code{censor} variable was used.
}
\item{datadensity}{
By default, \code{plot.val.surv} will show the data density on each curve
that is created as a result of \code{censor} being present.  Set
