\title{Intervening Event Setup}

\description{
Creates several new variables which help set up a dataset for modeling
with \code{cph} or \code{coxph} when there is a single binary time-dependent
covariable which turns on at a given time, and stays on.  This is
typical when analyzing the impact of an intervening event.
\code{ie.setup} creates a \code{Surv} object using the start time, stop time
format.  It also creates a binary indicator for the intervening event,
and a variable called \code{subs} that is useful when \code{attach}-ing a dataframe.
\code{subs} has observation numbers duplicated for subjects having an
intervening event, so those subject's baseline covariables (that are
not time-dependent) can be duplicated correctly.
}
\usage{
ie.setup(failure.time, event, ie.time, break.ties=FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{failure.time}{
a numeric variable containing the event or censoring times for the
terminating event
}
\item{event}{
a binary (0/1) variable specifying whether observations had the
terminating event (event=1) or were censored (event=0)
}
\item{ie.time}{
intervening event times.  For subjects having no intervening events,
the corresponding values of ie.time must be NA.
}
\item{break.ties}{
Occasionally intervening events are recorded as happening at exactly
the same time as the termination of follow-up for some subjects.
The \code{Surv} function will not allow this.  To randomly break the ties
by subtracting a random number from such tied intervening event times,
specify \code{break.ties=TRUE}.  The random number is uniform between zero and
the minimum difference between any two untied \code{failure.time}s.
}}
\value{
a list with components \code{S, ie.status, subs, reps}.  \code{S} is a \code{Surv}
object containing start and stop times for intervals of observation, 
along with event indicators.  \code{ie.status} is one if the intervening
event has occurred at the start of the interval, zero otherwise.
\code{subs} is a vector of subscripts that can be used to replicate other
variables the same way \code{S} was replicated.  \code{reps} specifies how many
times each original observation was replicated.  \code{S, ie.status, subs} are
all the same length (at least the number of rows for \code{S} is) and are longer than the original \code{failure.time} vector.
\code{reps} is the same length as the original \code{failure.time} vector.
The \code{subs} vector is suitable for passing to \code{validate.lrm} or \code{calibrate},
which pass this vector under the name \code{cluster} on to \code{predab.resample} so that bootstrapping can be
done by sampling with replacement from the original subjects rather than
from the individual records created by \code{ie.setup}.
